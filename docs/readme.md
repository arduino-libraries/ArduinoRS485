# Arduino RS485 library


The Arduino RS485 library enables you to send and receive data using the RS-485 standard with Arduino&reg; RS485 Shields, like the MKR 485 Shield. Please refer to the [MKR RS485 Shield](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKR485Shield) documentation for the specific settings about half, full duplex, and termination.

This library supports the MAX3157 and equivalent chipsets. 

To use this library:

```
#include <ArduinoRS485.h>
```
